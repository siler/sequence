# Server, does work

Server is responsible for turning render links into images and returning them.

# Commands

Do not use `npm` or `npx` commands in this directory. Instead, go to the workspace root (`../`) and run `npm -w server ...` or `npx -w server ...`. Even `just` commands can be easily run from root, such as `just server/build`.

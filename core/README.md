# Core

The core is the brains of Sequence and is what generates and renders diagrams from text.

# Commands

Do not use `npm` or `npx` commands in this directory. Instead, go to the workspace root (`../`) and run `npm -w core ...` or `npx -w core ...`. Even `just` commands can be easily run from root, such as `just core/build`.
